# Blockchain

A Blockchain prototype written in pure Java.

- The blockchain will adjust the "difficulty" based on how fast miners can mine a new block.

- Users can send messages to the blockchain (but cannot be deleted); the message is signed using
asymmetric key pair, 

- Each message can be checked using the public key for its authenticity.

- Other features:
  - Multithreaded
  - Proof of work
  - SHA256 HASH
  - Decentralized

- TODOs:
 - [ ] cryptocurrency
 - [ ] smart contract
